            <p>i am an Ardent lover of Tech. Growing up, i had always fiddled with tech appliances. unlike most of my friends who enjoyed football, tech and engineering had always been my passion. in my Jss3 i had built a Remote controlled Tipper truck for exhibition which caught the Attention of the Bishp of the Anglican diocess Most.Rev E.O. Chukwuma. as a result he awarded a scholarship to further my secondary studies. by the time i got into ss2 i had a deep passion for coding and programming and from then i decided i wanted to be a programmer and here i am today working so hard with the help of the upskill program to become a Maestro Software enginner.</p>
