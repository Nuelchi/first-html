            <p>i am an Ardent lover of Tech. Growing up, i had always fiddled with tech appliances. unlike most of my friends who enjoyed football, tech and engineering had always been my passion. in my Jss3 i had built a Remote controlled Tipper truck for exhibition which caught the Attention of the Bishp of the Anglican diocess Most.Rev E.O. Chukwuma. as a result he awarded a scholarship to further my secondary studies. by the time i got into ss2 i had a deep passion for coding and programming and from then i decided i wanted to be a programmer and here i am today working so hard with the help of the upskill program to become a Maestro Software enginner.</p>

            <p>Firstly i got to know of upskill through one of my friends, he introduced me to the program and encouraged me to join. i must also confess it is a thing of join to be a part of this platform where beginners are taken to the next level. within the next 7 weeks  want to really put in my best to get the most out of this program because that this is where it begins to get more interesting. i have pretty high expectations from upskill and  believe that by the end of this program i would have have a lot of progresses especially in the areas of CSS styyling and design. A ll the same i want to use this opportunity to appreciate the hosts and mentors in upskill for the amazing work that they are doing. I really Appreciate you all, God bless you all.</p>
